# Overview

We will build a RISC-V chip from scratch, are you ready for it? ðŸ˜Ž

## Contents

* [tutorial](broken-reference): build a RISC-V chip step by step, from single-cycle to pipelined
* [interfaces](broken-reference): serial interfaces and graphics interfaces
* [tools](broken-reference): provide some tools and guides that may be useful to you
* [devices](broken-reference): our devices documentations
* [misc](broken-reference): miscellaneous resources

{% hint style="info" %}
* If you don't familiar with fpga, check [introduction to FPGA](misc/introduction-to-fpga.md). ðŸ‘ˆ
* You may find [install vivado 24.1](tools/install-vivado-24.1.md) and [get started with vivado 24.1](tools/get-started-with-vivado-24.1.md) useful. ðŸ‘ˆ
* Some open-source and multiplatform tools like openFPGALoader and APIO can be alternatives to Vivado and Quartus. Basically, xilinx's and altera's FPGAs can be programmed in the same tool. ðŸ™€&#x20;
