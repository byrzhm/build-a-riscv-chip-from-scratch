# Serial Interface

How to connect an FPGA to a PC? For example, I want to send a message from a PC to an FPGA, and expect the FPGA will echo the same message back to PC.

We gonna use serial interfaces to establish the connection. More specifically, we gonna use RS232 interfaces.

Are there any other ways to connect an FPGA to a PC?
